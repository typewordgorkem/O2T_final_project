# O2T_final_project
This is a final project for school.

The O2T project is a pioneering initiative that seeks to transform sustainable fashion and advertising through the development of a wearable textile product equipped with an integrated digital screen. By leveraging a mobile application and the embedded digital screen, O2T technology empowers users to extend the longevity of their products by preventing discoloration and wear. This innovative approach not only mitigates waste and reduces carbon emissions but also introduces a dynamic advertising platform, particularly advantageous for athletes sponsored by companies. The mobile application provides users with control over displaying multiple sponsors' emblems on the screen, offering flexibility and adaptability. The O2T system comprises essential components, including a power source, a control unit, a microcontroller (such as an Arduino & Raspberry pi), and a flexible screen. The software aspect entails the development of a dedicated mobile application tailored specifically for the O2T Project. 
Our project maintains a streamlined focus on delivering an effective and user-friendly wearable technology solution. This abstract highlights the potential for future expansion and further details can be found within the comprehensive report. In summary, the O2T project presents an innovative and impactful solution for sustainable fashion and smart advertising, offering significant benefits for individuals and businesses alike.
